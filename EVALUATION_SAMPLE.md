## Requirements Compliance

### Functional Requirements (7/7)

| # | Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------------|--------|----------|

| 2 | Search bar filtering | Pass | Debounced search with in-memory filtering |
| 3 | Favorite button | Pass | `BreedListItem.kt` - Heart icon with toggle |

| 5 | Detail screen (all fields + favorite) | Pass | Origin, temperament, lifespan, description |
| 6 | Jetpack Navigation | Pass | NavHost with typed routes |
| 7 | Click → detail navigation | Pass | `MainScreen.kt:24` |

### Technical Requirements (4/4)

## Architecture Analysis

### Module Structure
```
app/              → Entry point, navigation shell, DI wiring
cat_breeds_api/   → Pure Kotlin module (domain contracts, no Android)
cat_breeds_data/  → Data layer (Room, Retrofit, mappers)
cat_breeds/       → Feature module (ViewModels, UI, use cases)
```

### Strengths
- **Pure Kotlin domain module** - Zero Android dependencies, fast compilation
- **Separate favorites table** - Survives cache refreshes
- **Reactive favorite updates** - Both screens observe Room Flows
- **Pagination-friendly design** - List observes only favorite IDs

### Areas for Improvement
- Use case layer could be expanded beyond `ToggleFavoriteUseCase`
- No domain-specific error types (uses generic `Throwable`)

---

## Testing Coverage

| Type | Coverage |
|------|----------|
| **Unit Tests** | ViewModels, Repository, UseCases, Mappers |
| **UI Tests** | Robolectric Compose tests (JVM-based) |
| **Screenshot Tests** | 7 reference images for visual regression |
| **E2E Tests** | MockWebServer + Hilt + in-memory Room |

**Rating: Excellent**

---

## Bonus Points (4/4)

| Bonus | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Error handling | Achieved - `Result` sealed class, graceful degradation |
| Pagination | Achieved - Manual implementation, page size 10 |
| Modular design | Achieved - 4 modules with clean dependencies |
| Integration/E2E tests | Achieved - Full flow tests with MockWebServer |

## Interview Questions

*Generated interview questions based on the codebase analysis.*

### Architecture Questions
1. "Why a separate favorites table instead of a column on breeds?"
2. "What happens if someone deep-links to a breed not in the cache?"
3. "Why is `cat_breeds_api` a pure Kotlin module?"

### Technical Deep-Dives
4. "Walk through the data flow when favoriting a breed from the list screen."
5. "How does pagination detect when there are no more pages?"
6. "Why in-memory search filtering instead of a Room query?"

### Pressure Points
7. "How do you handle configuration changes and process death?"
8. "Is `BreedRepositoryImpl` getting too large? How would you refactor?"
9. "Which parts did Claude Code write and how did you validate them?"

### Growth Questions
10. "What would you do differently if starting over?"
11. "How would this scale to 20 more screens?"
12. "What's the weakest part of this codebase?"

## AI-Generated Code Detection Probes

*Questions to verify understanding of implementation details.*

1. "When implementing debounced search, did you consider alternatives to `Flow.debounce()`?"
2. "Why 300ms for search debounce? How did you arrive at that number?"
3. "Without looking: what's the constant name for page size in `BreedListViewModel`?"

---

## Summary

**Key Strengths:**
1. Multi-module Clean Architecture with proper dependency direction
2. Comprehensive test coverage (unit, UI, screenshot, E2E)
3. Production-ready patterns (offline, pagination, reactive updates)

**Areas for Growth:**
1. Expand use case layer
2. Domain-specific error types

**Final Assessment:**
Exceeds expectations for a coding challenge. Shows senior-level proficiency in modern Android development.
